- Temperatures are slightly colder in December as you would expect for Winter but the temperature differential between December and June for the average temperature  is only around 4° F.
- Precipitation for both months is low with an average of .013 inches of rain for June and .21 inches for December.
- Minimum and Maximum temperatures for both months seem to be outliers.
- Temperatures in the 50 Percentile are inline with the average with standard deviations of around 3.5° F which is small.
- Overall the ranges in temperature and precicipation seem to be close together which would mean there aren't big changes year round which would make the location suitable for the shop.
